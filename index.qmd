How significant is the environmental impact of various food products? Using data from a comprehensive dataset on the environmental impact of food production from Kaggle, this project analyzes and predicts the potential carbon footprint associated with different foods. The dataset was meticulously cleaned and standardized to ensure accurate modeling. We explored several regression models, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, Ada Boost, and K-Nearest Neighbour, to predict the total emissions generated by various food items. Our analysis found that the Random Forest model provided the most accurate predictions, offering valuable insights into the primary contributors to food-related emissions. This project aims to inform sustainable food choices by highlighting the environmental consequences of different dietary options.
